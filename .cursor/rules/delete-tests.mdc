# Test File Cleanup Rule

## When to Apply
- After writing any test script, data file, or temporary file for testing purposes
- After running tests that create temporary files
- After debugging sessions that generate test data

## What to Remove
- Test scripts (files with "test" in the name)
- Temporary data files created for testing
- Test configuration files that are no longer needed
- Debug output files
- Temporary directories created for testing

## Process
1. **Identify test files**: Look for files with patterns like `*test*`, `*Test*`, `test-*`, `*_test*`
2. **Verify completion**: Ensure the test or debugging session is complete
3. **Remove immediately**: Delete the file using appropriate tools
4. **Confirm cleanup**: Verify the file has been removed from the project

## File Patterns to Target
- `test-*.js/ts/jsx/tsx/py/sh/bat`
- `*test*.js/ts/jsx/tsx/py/sh/bat`
- `*Test*.js/ts/jsx/tsx/py/sh/bat`
- `*_test*.js/ts/jsx/tsx/py/sh/bat`
- Files in `temp/`, `tmp/`, `test-data/`, `test-scripts/`, `test-files/` directories

## Exceptions
- Do NOT remove files that are part of the actual test suite (like `__tests__/` directories)
- Do NOT remove files that are explicitly part of the project's testing infrastructure
- Do NOT remove files that contain important data or configurations

## Tools to Use
- Use `delete_file` tool for individual files
- Use terminal commands for bulk removal when appropriate
- Always confirm deletion before proceeding
