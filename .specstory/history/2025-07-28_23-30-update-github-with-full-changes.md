# Response 1

I'll help you update GitHub with all the changes in your slide-builder project. Let me first check the current git status to see what changes need to be committed and pushed.


---

```bash
cd /Users/romanolivera/Documents/GitHub/slide-builder && git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   app/page.tsx
        modified:   components/slide.tsx
        modified:   package.json
        modified:   pnpm-lock.yaml

Based on my analysis of the slide-builder project, here's a comprehensive description for a database of tools:

## **Slide Builder - Professional Presentation Creation Tool**

**Category:** Content Creation, Presentation Tools, Web Applications

**Description:**
Slide Builder is a sophisticated Next.js web application designed for creating professional presentation slides from Markdown content. It transforms simple text input into visually appealing slides with custom backgrounds, interactive image uploads, and comprehensive theme management. The tool is specifically optimized for content creators, educators, and professionals who need to quickly generate high-quality presentation materials.

**Key Features:**
- **Markdown-to-Slide Conversion:** Automatically parses structured Markdown content into professional slide layouts with titles, subtitles, bullet points, quotes, and callouts
- **Interactive Image Management:** Click-to-upload functionality for slide content images with automatic PNG conversion and resizing (600x400px)
- **Advanced Theme System:** Create and save custom themes with multiple background images (first slide, middle slides, last slide) and customizable text colors
- **Bilingual Interface:** Full Spanish and English support with persistent language preferences
- **Real-time Preview:** Live slide preview as you type with instant visual feedback
- **Export Capabilities:** Download individual slides or complete presentations as high-quality PNG images (1080x1350px)
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Comprehensive Instructions:** Built-in step-by-step guide accessible via the interface

**Technical Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **Image Processing:** Sharp library for image conversion and optimization
- **Markdown Rendering:** React Markdown for content parsing
- **Export:** html-to-image library for PNG generation
- **State Management:** React hooks with localStorage for theme persistence

**Use Cases:**
- **Content Creators:** Generate social media slides from written content
- **Educators:** Create educational presentations quickly
- **Business Professionals:** Develop sales pitches and training materials
- **Marketers:** Convert blog posts into visual presentations
- **Social Media Managers:** Create carousel posts for platforms like Instagram

**Unique Value Proposition:**
Unlike traditional presentation software, Slide Builder focuses on rapid content-to-visual conversion with a streamlined workflow. The tool eliminates the complexity of traditional slide editors while providing professional output quality. Its Markdown-based approach makes it ideal for users who prefer writing over designing, while the theme system ensures consistent branding and visual appeal.

**Target Audience:**
- Content creators and social media managers
- Educators and trainers
- Business professionals and consultants
- Marketing teams
- Anyone needing to quickly convert written content into visual presentations

**Deployment:** Web-based application that can be self-hosted or deployed to platforms like Vercel, with no external dependencies or API requirements beyond the core application.

This description captures the tool's comprehensive functionality, technical sophistication, and practical applications for various professional use cases.

Based on the slide-builder project, here's a concise paragraph description for your internal tool database:

**Slide Builder** is an internal web application built with Next.js that converts Markdown text into professional presentation slides. Users write structured content using simple Markdown syntax (titles with ##, bullet points with -, quotes with >) and the tool automatically generates visually appealing slides with custom backgrounds, interactive image uploads, and theme management. The application features a bilingual interface (Spanish/English), real-time preview, and allows downloading slides as high-quality PNG images. It's designed for content creators, educators, and marketing teams who need to quickly transform written content into visual presentations without the complexity of traditional slide editors. The tool includes a comprehensive theme system for custom backgrounds and text colors, making it ideal for creating branded presentations and social media carousel content efficiently.
