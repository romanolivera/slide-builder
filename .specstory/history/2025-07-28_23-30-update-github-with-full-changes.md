I'll help you update GitHub with all the changes in your slide-builder project. Let me first check the current git status to see what changes need to be committed and pushed.


---

```bash
cd /Users/romanolivera/Documents/GitHub/slide-builder && git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   app/page.tsx
        modified:   components/slide.tsx
        modified:   package.json
        modified:   pnpm-lock.yaml

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .specstory/history/2025-07-28_06-14-initial-sync-with-github-repository.

        .specstory/history/2025-07-28_23-07-polishing-ui-for-image-management.md
        public/.DS_Store

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

Now I'll add all the changes and commit them with a descriptive message:


---

```bash
git add .
```

```
romanolivera@Romans-MacBook-Pro slide-builder % git add .
```

---

```bash
git commit -m "Update slide builder with UI improvements and image management features"
```

```
